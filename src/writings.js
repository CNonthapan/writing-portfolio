The air curtain blows on me as I step inside, cold air hitting my skin. The air
carries a scent of dust and something metallic, like an old film reel that’s been
sitting too long in an attic. Display cases stretched from wall to wall, stacked with
countless cameras and lenses in neat, disciplined rows—Old school SLRs, DSLRs,
mirrorless, compacts—you name it.
The man behind the counter looks up from a battered photography magazine.
He gives me a nod, the kind reserved for people who don’t really know what they
want.
I used to come here with him.
We’d linger by the display cases, our breath fogging the glass as we argued
about what makes a photographer great. He swore by a minimalist entry-level
camera, while I adamantly stuck to a more robust, professional one.
He never cared about specs. To him, it’s just a box that lets you steal
moments, and the rest was down to the hands that held it. He never cared if it was
an entry-level compact from a decade ago or the latest state of the art mirrorless.
He had this way of making a photo feel more than pixels, like it carried to air of
that moment, the way the world was before it moved on.
I obsessed over the details. Aperture, ISO range, sensor sizes, max shutter
speeds. I spent hours watching reviews, scrolling through endless comparison,
looking at technical stats like it was the key to unlock some hidden truth. He used
to make fun of me for having “Gear Acquisition Syndrome.” In a sense, he was right.
I buy a new lens, then I buy the next in a vain attempt to achieve the next level of
photography.
“You don’t trust your skills,” he told me once, looking through the specs sheet
of a new camera that I showed him. “ You think if you bought the perfect camera,
you’ll finally take the perfect shot. But it’s never the camera, is it?”
I hated that he was right.
Now, he’s six thousand miles away, in a city where the rain smells different,
where the light falls differently, where he points his lens at strangers I’ll never
meet. He took nothing fancy with him, just a small mirrorless his dad bought for
him years ago and a simple nifty fifty, something that fit into a pocket, something
that won’t get in the way.

By the window, a mirrorless, the flagship model, gleamed under the display
light. I pick it up, turning it over in my hands, sleek, impossibly light for its size,
nothing like the bulk of a DSLR. It feels effortless.
“That’s one of our most cutting-edge professional mirrorless,” the man behind
the counter says, “45 megapixel full-frame sensor, shoots sharp, great in low light,
lightning fast autofocus, you won’t ever miss a shot.”
“That’s the problem,” I mutter before I can stop myself.
The old me—the me before him—would’ve loved it. But I’ve started noticing
the way imperfection tells more story than something flawlessly composed. The way
the weight of a camera slows you down, makes you think before you shoot.
He hated DSLRs. “Too much in the way,” he said, watching me fiddle with the
dials. “You miss the shot because you’re too busy making it perfect”

“You get to shape the shot,” I argued, “you decide how it comes out”
“Or you could just take it,” he said, raising his mirrorless and snapping a
portrait of me before I could react.
I tried to take a portrait of him in return, but portraits aren’t really my thing.
I find birds are more interesting subjects, they don’t argue as much. The portrait
ended up being mediocre, poorly exposed, no depth of field.
I still have that photo. I found it yesterday, tucked deep in a drawer of
keepsakes. I never realized how good it was. He’s mid-sentence, half-annoyed,
half-smiling, caught in the space between words. The kind of moment I would’ve
missed if I was messing with the aperture for the perfect, creamy bokeh.
I went back to the flagship mirrorless that I’ve been eying up. I picked it up
again, feeling the weight of the shutter. It’s what I would’ve chosen before. It’s what
I thought made me a photographer.
But now, I think about all the things he saw and I didn’t. How he captured
the in-between and how I waited for the perfect shot that often never arrived. And
how, in the end, I had expensive gear, but he was the one left with photos.
He used to roll his eyes at things like that. “You like things that make your
life difficult,” he said, scrolling through the shots I’ve taken—too dark, too grainy, a
fraction of a second too late. “You like the idea of struggling with something, as if it
means more that way”

Maybe he was right.
Maybe that’s why I stayed after he was already half-gone, his mind already
in that city.
I wonder if he still takes photos in the new city. If he still takes his photo
without obsessing over noise. If he still stops in the middle of the street to capture
something before it disappears. If he still doesn’t care if the camera in his hand is
the best or worst.
If he still thinks of me when he sees a camera, the same way I do.
I lifted the viewfinder to my eyes and hit the shutter button. There’s no
memory card inside, nothing to keep what I captured.
Some things aren’t meant to be kept, even if you want to. I set the camera
back down and approach the counter for a new SD card.
The man behind the counter watches me, waiting. “Didn’t find what you were
looking for?”
“Not today, just this” I shake my head as he rings up the box.
